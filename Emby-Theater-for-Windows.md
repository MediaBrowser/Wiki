# Setup Guide
* Install the app using one of the above methods, the app will then automatically find your local Emby Server(s). If it cannot find your server or you are attempting to connect to a remote server, the app will present you with options to connect manually or use Emby Connect.

# Direct Play Media Formats
* Direct Play highly dependent on your Windows system. Most formats are supported in newer versions of Windows, if not natively supported they are usually just a codec away.

# Best Practices for Direct Play
* Leave the app's streaming bitrate setting on the default value of Auto, if possible. The app will perform bandwidth tests with your Emby Server to determine the maximum playable bitrate.

* If you are customizing the bitrate setting, then you will need to compare the bitrate of your files to the bitrate setting in the app. You can find the bitrate of a file by checking the media info in the web interface. If the bitrate of a file is higher than the setting in the app, transcoding will be required. Increasing the bitrate setting in the app can help reduce transcoding, but may impact playback performance if your network connection is not fast enough to handle it.
